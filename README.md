## 🚀 How It Works

1. On page load, the `getUsers()` function fetches 6 users from the API.
2. User cards are created dynamically using JavaScript DOM methods.
3. Each card displays:

   * Profile picture
   * Name & email
   * Static bio and stats
   * Follow button
4. The **Refresh Users** button:

   * Animates the refresh icon
   * Fetches a new set of users
   * Re-renders the cards instantly
